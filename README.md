# Daily LeetCode DSA Solutions

[View my LeetCode Account](https://leetcode.com/u/ShubhmiTTaL/)

Welcome to my repository! üöÄ

This repository contains my **daily solutions** to LeetCode problems focusing on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. The goal of this project is to enhance my problem-solving skills by solving various coding problems consistently.

## üìÖ Daily Updates

I will be adding solutions to LeetCode problems **every day**. These problems will cover a variety of topics, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching
- Bit Manipulation

Each problem is solved using **best practices**, ensuring:

- Optimal time and space complexity.
- Readable and well-documented code.
- Explanation of the approach for each solution.

## üìñ My Journey

Follow my progress as I commit to solving LeetCode problems daily. I aim to:

- Improve my problem-solving abilities.
- Master various data structures and algorithms.
- Prepare for technical coding interviews.
